                    <p>But how Do it Know? - Clark Scott</p>
                    <p>An absolutely perfect read for those who want to learn the fundamentals of computer architecture from a ground-up level. Despite being 200 or so pages, it's ultimately a quick read that gives you a deep understanding of the material.</p>

                    <p>The Book of Forces - Metin Bektas</p>
                    <p>This book is exactly what it says on the tin. It provides you with a large number of different forces, as well as the understanding to know exactly why objects in the world behave as they do. If you are a highschool student who wants to get an early jump on physics, this book fits your entire semester into 130 pages. It is filled with examples and problems that build your understanding of the natural world.</p>

                    <p>Seven Brief Lessons on Physics - Carlo Rovelli</p>
                    <p>I read this book back in 2019 when I was starting to feel that I wanted to pursue a more science-based skillset. It was very cheap, and contains surface level explanations of a variety of things from quantum mechanics and general relativity. It is a great read for the curious mind.</p>

                    <p>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy - Douglass Adams</p>
                    <p>As with everything written by Douglass Adams, this book has a special charm to it that is just unbeatable. The main thing about this book is that it's just plain <em>funny</em>, and is to date (December 12th '25), the only book to ever make me laugh.</p>

                    <p>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (Parts II -> V) - Douglass Adams</p>
                    <p>While I have read all of these books, it has been years and I do not feel like they are clear enough in my mind for me to write about them until I read them again.</p>

                    <p>2001: A Space Odyssey - Arthur C. Clarke</p>
                    <p>2001: A Space Odyssey is one of those books that really grab you and takes hold, and doesn't let go until you finish the book. Even after finishing it, I still thought about it (and frequently do). It has great mysteries and so few answers that I was left imagining what happened to Bowman in his final(?) moments for a long time. This is a great read for anyone who enjoys fiction, sci-fi or not.</p>

                <div class="book">
                    <p>2010: Odyssey Two - Arthur C. Clarke</p>
                    <p>The much less popular sequel to 2001, it has been unfairly overlooked as the second book in a set of absolute bangers. The second book places much greater emphasis on the emotional, and the human elements of the characters. We get a deeper look into Dave Bowman, as well as HAL 9000 and those behind his creation. It also adds a host of new and enjoyable characters, my favorite being Chandra.</p>

                <div class="book">
                    <p>2061: Odyssey Three - Arthur C. Clarke</p>
                    <p>The third installment in the series, we get another look at the protagonist of the second (Dr. Heywood Floyd) in his old age as he tours the Solar System as a kind of celebrity. It expands upon the second book greatly, with a healthy dash of alternate history that directly influences the plot. </p>

                    <p>The Nine Billion Names of God - Arthur C. Clarke</p>
                    <p>In 'The Nine Billion Names of God', Computer engineers and Tibetan Monks engineer the end of the Universe. It's thought provoking without being very heady, and short enough that you can finish it in one sitting. This one stuck with me for a while.</p>

                    <p>The Great Gatsby - F. Scott Fitzgerald</p>
                    <p>Although I only read this because of a highschool English class, it was still a good read. I was most interested by the character drama, which is far from my usual taste. It's popular for a reason!</p>
