            <p>I've ported over the blog posts from old versions of this website. You will see "?" on the older blog entries because my previous dating system didn't include the day. Whoops!</p>

                <p>Having worked for several months at Target, I can now attest that my previous job was worse than I thought. The management here is kind, and so are my coworkers. There is however an issue with what corporate <em>expects</em> we can do versus what our <em>managers</em> know we can do. This causes issues where people from corporate will show up and demand that we perform an impossible labor, despite reality. It's starting to get on my nerves.</p>

                <p>I've found a job at Target. It's far better than McDonalds, but there are still some pains when it comes to management. Definitely an improvement though.</p>
